			<p>Hey there! I'm <a href = "2015-05-15.pdf">Kristin</a>, and welcome to my website!  </p>
			<p>So what brought you here?  Maybe you saw the link on one of my <a href = "http://www.facebook.com">social media</a> pages?  Maybe I begged you to take a look at it and now you are finally doing it?  Or maybe you are just creeping.  That's cool too.</p>
			<p>The point is that I am just happy to have you here!  So who even is Kristin?  Well I can answer your questions. (current work in progress) </p>
