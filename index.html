				<p>Hey there! I'm <a href = "2015-07-07.pdf">Kristin</a>, and welcome to my website!  </p>


				<p>So what brought you here?  Maybe you saw the link on my <a href = "https://instagram.com/kaybeezeee/">instagram</a>,  <a href = "https://twitter.com/kaybeezee">twitter</a>, or <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/pub/kristin-beese/a4/424/901">linkedin</a>?  Maybe I begged you to take a look at it and now you are finally doing it?  Or maybe you are just creeping.  That's cool too.</p>
				<p>The point is that I am just happy to have you here!  So who even is Kristin?  Well I can answer your questions. (current work in progress) </p>
