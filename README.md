<h1> Personal Website</h1>
I created my own personal website in order to learn web development over the summer of 2015.  I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery to create the site.

<h1> On the Road Website</h1>
I also host my On the Road App's website on beese.github.io.  The website allows users to get more information about the application, have a link to the iOS app store to download the app, and it has my contact information for if someone has any comments or concerns about the app.
